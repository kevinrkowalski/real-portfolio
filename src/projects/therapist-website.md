This website was needed by a Therapist looking to grow her online presence. She had never had a website before and was looking to present information to new potential clientel in a friendly and inviting way.

We started the project by discussing her needs and going over all the features she wanted to see on her new site. From there, we talked design basics and she sent me some ideas of sites she liked. Once we had that together I drafted up some designs and after approval built the site. It was built to be fully responsive and look great on devices of all sizes from mobile phones to desktop computers.

The website was built to put a focus on sharing information regarding her services while allowing potential clients a quick way to contact her for an appointment. Since completion, the client has recieved numerous communications from potential clientel via her website.
