This website was completely non-functional and was showing PHP errors when I was brought in to restore it to it's previous state. The website was built with a fully custom WordPress theme.

After some investigation I found the main causes of the PHP errors and worked to fix them. After fixing the cuase of the errors I had to completely rebuild the style and look of the site from nothing more than some old screenshots. I was able to accomplish this over the course of a few days and the client was very satisfied with the site.
