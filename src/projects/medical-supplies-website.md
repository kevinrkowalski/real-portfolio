This site was created for a medical sales professional who had previously only been selling products through catalogs. He wanted the site to feel fun and lighthearted, while still being professional and clean. 

The website features a fully responsive design to suit customers on all devices including phones, tablets, and desktops. It also includes a full storefront with all the medical products listed and available for purchase. This site was created with a fellow designer and developer, together we crafted the layout and built the functionality to meet the needs of the owner.
